# Module Summary

## NoSQL / MongoDB
* Alternative to SQL databases
* No strict schemas, fewer relations
* You can of course use schemas and reference-based relations but you got more flexibility
* Often, relations are also created by embedding other documents / data

## Working with MongoDB
* Use the official MongoDB Driver
* Commands like insertOne(), find(), updateOne() and deleteOne() make CRUD operations very simple
* Check the official docs to learn about all avaliable operations + configurations / operators
* All operations are promise-based, hence you can easily chain them for more complex flows
