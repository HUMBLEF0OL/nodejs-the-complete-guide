# Module Summary

## NPM
* npm stands for “Node Package Manager” and it allows you to manage your Node project and its dependencies
* You can initialize a project and its dependencies
* npm scripts can be defined in the package.json to give you “shortcuts” to common tasks / commands

## 3rd Party Packages
* Node projects typically don’t just use core modules and custom code but also third-party packages
* You install them via npm
* You can differentiate between production dependencies (--save), development dependencies (--save-dev) and global dependencies (-g)

## Types of Errors
* Syntax, runtime and logical errors can break your app
* Syntax and runtime errors throw (helpful) error messages (with line numbers!)
* Logical errors can be fixed with testing and the help of the debugger

## Debugging
* Use the VS Code Node debugger to step into your code and go through it step by step
* Analyze variable values at runtime
* Look into (and manipulate) variables at runtime
* Set breakpoints cleverly (i.e. respect the async / event-driven nature)
