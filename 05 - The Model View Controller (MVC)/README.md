# Module Summary

## Model
* Responsible for representing your data

* Responsible for managing your data (saving, fetching...)

* Doesn't matter if you manage data in memory, files, databases

* Contains data-related logic

## View
* What the user sees

* Shouldn't contain too much logic

## Controller
* Connects Model and View

* Should only make sure that the two can communicate (in both directions)
