# Module Summary

## REST Concepts & Ideas

- REST APIs are all about data, no UI logic is exchanged
- REST APIs are normal Node servers which expose different endpoints (HTTP method + path) for clients to send requests to
- JSON is the common data format that is used both for requests and responses
- REST APIs are decoupled from the clients that use them

## Requests & Responses
- Attach data in JSON format and let the other end know by setting the "Content-Type" header
- CORS errors occur when using an API that does not set CORS headers
